# Election Analysis

## Project Overview

#### In this challenge, we performed an analysis and a report of the results of a local congressional election in Colorado using Python 3.9.2 and Visual Studio Code. Our job was to help Tom, a Colorado Board Election employee, who had given us the task of analyzing a CSV file format with the election results.

#### In other words, our purpose was to make a report on the elections in the counties of Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe.
