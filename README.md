# Election Analysis

## Project Overview

#### In this challenge, we performed an analysis and a report of the results of a local Congressional Election in Colorado using Python and Visual Studio Code. Our job was to help Tom, a Colorado Board Election employee, who had given us the task of analyzing a CSV file format with the election results.

#### In other words, our purpose was to make a report on the elections in the counties of Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe. We'll be reporting the total numbers of the votes cast, the total number of votes each candidate received, the percentages of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on popular votes.

## Resources
#### We perform an analysis with Python 3.9.7 and VS Code 1.66.1 using a CSV file to report the election results.

#### - Data Source: election_results.csv

## Summary
#### The analysis of the election show that:

#### There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
#### 
#### - The candidates were:
####    - Charles Casper Stockham
####    - Diane DeGette
####    - Raymon Anthony Doane

#### The candidate results were:
####    - Charles Casper Stockham received **23.0%** of the vote and **85,213** number of votes.
####    - Diane DeGette received **73.0%** of the vote and **272,892** number of votes.
####    - Raymon Anthony Doane received **3.1%** of the vote and **11,606** number of votes.

#### -The winner of the election was: Diane DeGette, who received **73.8%** of the vote and **272,892** number of votes.

#### - The results of voter turnout by county were: 
####    - Jefferson County tuve 10.5% de votantes, for a total of 38, 855 voters
####    - Denver county had ____ voters and porcentae of votes of the total count
####    - Arapahoe

#### - The county with the highest voter turnout was Denver County, pues tuvo el 82.8% de los votantes de todas las elecciones

## Election-Audit summary
#### The Python script that we utilized to analyze the election results can be used in future elections. That is, the code can be adapted for not only local but also state and federal elections.
#### In other words, we can customize the code according to the requirements of each election. For example, we can analyze a federal election and report the results for each State in a similar way as we did for counties in this election, but with some specific modifications. This Python script can also be adjusted for elections in other countries.
#### It's important to highlight that using programming languages such as Python in electoral processes is practical, safer and allows fewer errors and greater transparency in the analysis.
